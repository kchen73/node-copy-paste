# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I used the README file to understand the purpose and methods of the module, and initially skimmed through the main code to find those methods. I
used the examples in the README file to aid the creation of my examples and added extra console.log statements to ensure that my examples were 
working properly. The process of taking the time to understand and practice coding with the module helped me familiarize and get comfortable with the
module. One aspect of my module's code that made it easy to understand was the clarity of variable names. It was easy to track what the variables were
and what purpose the variables were serving. On the other hand, the formatting of the code made it difficult to read at times as some lines of code
could be refactored into multiple lines for the sake of readibility.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> To me, raising the level of abstraction is explaining what the code is doing to someone who has little to no programming experience. In other words,
it's taking code and turning it into a summary of words describing what the code will process. If I had to explain how to write a good comment to a
new CSE 142 student, I would tell him/her to step into the shoes of the user who will look at your code. If your user can follow what the code is 
doing with the help of your comments without any extensive prior knowledge, then your comments are good.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me around 8 hours to complete the assignment.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from online sources, and simple debugging issue assistance from a classmate (Abhishek Joshi).


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> When installing jsdoc, be sure to install it with the -g command so that the module is global. Maybe more examples of good comments would be nice.
